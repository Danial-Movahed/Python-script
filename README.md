# Script

A Script written using python for who are new to linux mint!
This script uses xdotool and xmessage for ease

The effects option is only for cinnamon but
you can use it with any linux distro and any DE.

## Using
No special guides just download main.py and ooh.mp3
in same directory and run or use the command below.

`wget https://github.com/Danial-Movahed/Python-script/raw/main/ooh.mp3 ; curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Danial-Movahed/Python-script/main/main.py | python3`

It will autoinstallthe dependencies but you need
to have policykit and gnome-terminal installed.

### Note
The effects option is still in beta and has some bugs.
